ArduinoAD
=========

This program utilizes an Arduino as an analog-to-digital converter to
sample an analog signal between 0-5 volts.  The software supports reading
from 1-6 analog inputs simultaneously with a user-defined frequency, limited
by the serial data transfer speed.  In practice about 1-5 kHz frequencies
can be obtained.

The software consists of two parts:  Arduino software for the A/D conversion
and graphical Java software for data acquisition and plotting.



NOTE:  This project is in a rather raw and unpolished state.  If currently
does not have scripts to build the application, but rather depends on being
run from Eclipse.


Arduino program
---------------

Upload the program in arduino/MultiInput/MultiInput.pde to the Arduino.


Java software
-------------

You need to have RXTX library installed.  On Debian-based systems use
    sudo apt-get install librxtx-java

To start the software, run the class gui.DataAnalyzer from Eclipse.


Usage
-----

Click "Configure" to set up communication options.

Click "Start listening" to start data transfer from the Arduino.

Click "Plot" to display a real-time plot of the data.

Select a file using "Browse" and check "Save data to file" to save data
to a file in CSV format.  Add text to the text entry box to add a
comment to the beginning of the saved data file.


By default the software uses two bytes to communicate each measured
10-bit value, and uses the extra bits to detect missed bytes and timing
errors.

If "Fast 8-bit mode" is selected, only one input is used and that is
read and the highest 8 bits are output to the serial link as fast as
possible.  This allows the maximum sampling frequency, but at reduced
precision.


Calibration / scaling
---------------------

The boxes on the left side define linear scaling for the values:  
     [input value (0...1023)]  [output value]  
Clicking the "Cal" button sets the corresponding input value to the
current input value.


For example, calibration of a scale using a known weight:
 1. Remove any weight on the scale
 2. Set output value on first line to "0"
 3. Click "Cal" on first line
 4. Place the known weight on scale
 5. Set output value on second line to the known weight
 6. Click "Cal" on second line


You can use the buttons for preset calibration values:

    5V    Scale input values to 0...5V (analog input to Arduino)
    1:1   Set 1:1 scaling, output = input
    Tare  Subtract current output value from all output values
